# reverse-modulus

A quick program I wrote to find the "inverse modulus" specifically for use with inserter clocking in Factorio.

```
where
 A % B = C

find A, B for some value of C
```

In game you use 'A' as the constant combinator, and 'B' for the arithmetic combinator in modulus mode to make a clock
